# Arcolinux Customization for Gnome Desktop

The scripts and config files presented here are intended solely for my personal use, but made available so that anyone stumbling across the repo should feel free to adapt them for their own personal use as well.

Scripts are intended to be executed in sequence with full reboots between executions.

Ensure that each script is made executable with:
``` bash
$ sudo chmod +x 01-optimize-os.sh
```
